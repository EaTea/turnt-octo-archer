\section{Conclusion} \label{secConclusion}

We have looked at our seven questions that frame our analysis.
In the process we have discarded two models of learning and how they affect
effort in a project.
Our third model has been the most robust, even though it might not have fit as
well as our other models.
We note that there were measurable and similar effects of having prior
knowledge about a problem upon the effort required.\\
\\
Further research should be undertaken to correct the confounding factors upon
the experiment and results as noted in section \ref{secMethod}.
We also ought to reason as to why our two discarded models produced nonsensical
results and if it is possible to repair them.
