\section{Results} \label{secResults}

We present our results from each of our fits.
We used Wolfram Mathematica 9 to calibrate our models, and much of our analysis
assumes the correctness of Wolfram Mathematica 9's kernel and functions.\\
\\
This section of results is organised as follows.
Subsection \ref{subsecData} briefly gives some salient points about the data
itself, such as the mean time to complete each attempt and the standard
deviation.
Subsection \ref{subsecP1LA} shows the results of fitting our three models to
\PO\ using \LA.
Subsection \ref{subsecP1LB} shows the results of fitting our three moodels to
\PO\ using \LB.
Subsection \ref{subsecP2LA} shows the results of fitting our three models to
\PT\ using \LA.

\subsection{Analysing the data} \label{subsecData}

Some basic analyses that we performed on the data are presented below.
Although they do not contribute to answering our seven questions, we can make
some further comments and possible insights into the data and its usefulness.

First, we begin by analysing the data for \PO\ when it was completed four
separate times in \LA, as shown in table \ref{tableP1La}.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Attempt} &  {\bf Mean} & {\bf Standard Deviation} \\
\AZ & 172.857 & 91.6195 \\
\AO & 91.2143 & 69.0698 \\
\AT & 73.7857 & 49.6343 \\
\ATh & 40.2143 & 28.722
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data from the analysis of \PO\ when completed with \LA.}

\end{table}

Table \ref{tableP1LB} shows the analysis of the data for completing \PO\ in
\LB\ four times.
\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

{\bf Attempt} &  {\bf Mean} & {\bf Standard Deviation} \\

\end{tabular}

Table \ref{tableP2LA} shows the analysis of the data for completing \PT\ in
\LA\ four times.
\begin{table}
