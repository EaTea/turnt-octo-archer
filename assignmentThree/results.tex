\section{Results} \label{secResults}

We present our results from each of our fits.
We used Wolfram Mathematica 9 to calibrate our models, and much of our analysis
assumes the correctness of Wolfram Mathematica 9's kernel and functions.\\
\\
This section of results is organised as follows.
Subsection \ref{subsecData} briefly gives some salient points about the data
itself, such as the mean time to complete each attempt and the standard
deviation.
Subsection \ref{subsecP1LA} shows the results of fitting our three models to
\PO\ using \LA.
Subsection \ref{subsecP1LB} shows the results of fitting our three moodels to
\PO\ using \LB.
Subsection \ref{subsecP2LA} shows the results of fitting our three models to
\PT\ using \LA.

\subsection{Analysing the data} \label{subsecData}

Some basic analyses that we performed on the data are presented below.
Although they do not contribute to answering our seven questions, we can make
some further comments and possible insights into the data and its usefulness.

First, we begin by analysing the data for \PO\ when it was completed four
separate times in \LA, as shown in table \ref{tableP1La}.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Attempt} &  {\bf Mean} & {\bf Standard Deviation} \\
\hline
\AZ & 172.857 & 91.6195 \\
\hline
\AO & 91.2143 & 69.0698 \\
\hline
\AT & 73.7857 & 49.6343 \\
\hline
\ATh & 40.2143 & 28.722 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data from the analysis of \PO\ when completed with \LA.}
\label{tableP1LA}
\end{table}

This analyses suggests that the students began with a very wide range of abilities
and domain knowledge about the problem.
We can see what they began with needing almost 3 hours to finish the task, with a
standard deviation of more than 50\% of the mean.
As they continued to practice on the problem, the mean sharply decreased and the
standard deviation (approximately the spread of student times) began to contract.
However, the standard deviation as a percentage of the mean is still quite high.
This suggests that although the skill of the group as a whole was increasing, the
rates of learning, and the way that each student approached each iteration were quite
different across the entire group.

Table \ref{tableP1LB} shows the analysis of the data for completing \PO\ in
\LB\ four times.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Attempt} &  {\bf Mean} & {\bf Standard Deviation} \\
\AZ & 102.643 & 40.3229 \\
\hline
\AO & 62.7143 & 38.0777 \\
\hline
\AT & 50.1429  & 30.1046 \\
\hline
\ATh & 43.5714 & 27.2134\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data from the analysis of \PO\ when completed with \LB.}
\label{tableP1LB}
\end{table}

We can immediately see that the students were much faster in their first attempt for
\PO\ in \LB.
We will compare their differences more in section \ref{secAnalysis}.
It is worth noting that the spread of times is much smaller and the mean times are lower.
However, we also note that subsequent attempts did not show as much improvement as in the
first set of data.
The mean of their final times was comparable to the mean time taken for the final attempt
of \PO\ in \LA, but the spread has dramatically decreased.
This suggests that the students' skills and knowledge were converging and suggests this
dataset was much more reliable.

Table \ref{tableP2LA} shows the analysis of the data for completing \PT\ in
\LA\ four times.
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Attempt} &  {\bf Mean} & {\bf Standard Deviation} \\
\hline
\AZ & 100.143 & 70.1415 \\
\hline
\AO & 54.2143 & 38.573 \\
\hline
\AT & 49.9286  & 38.8794 \\
\hline
\ATh & 39.1429 & 34.9436
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data from the analysis of \PT\ when completed with \LA.}
\label{tableP2LA}
\end{table}

This dataset suggests that the knowledge from the previous problem domain transferred
over to the new dataset quite well.
The average time required to complete the problem was lower, but the spread of times was much higher.
The spread also did not converge as readily or tightly as the previous dataset.
We note that the differences in times between each dataset were far more erratic.
This suggests that language and resource changes are easier to deal with than problem domain
changes.
