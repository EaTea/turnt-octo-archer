\section{Conclusion}

We have simulated multiple runs of a software defect finding-fixing process.
The recommended strategy that we suggest is to prioritise fixing major bugs,
whilst not allowing the defect queue to go over a certain threshold.\\
\\
We believe that the method we used for simulation was not entirely sound, and
would recommend fixing it to improve the relaibility of samples.
From there, the open questions that remain are
\begin{itemize}
  \item can we address the assumptions we made at the beginning and incorporate
  them into our model?
  \item can we automate the strategy comparison process to evolve and converge
  on a strategy that gives the greatest benefit for a set of metrics?
\end{itemize}
