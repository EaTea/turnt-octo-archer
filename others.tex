\chapter{Defect detection and prevention techniques}
\label{chap:otherdets}

Before discussing code reviews, it is worthwhile to introduce and survey other defect
detection techniques.
We can analyse their relative strengths and weaknesses, and discuss why subtle
errors might escape these techniques.\\
\\
To address our claims that code reviews have long term benefits, such as defect
prevention properties, we ought to look at different defect prevention
techniques as well.
We will examine three areas of defect detection, and three areas of defect
prevention.
The three defect detection areas are
\begin{itemize}
  \item Test-driven
\end{itemize}
The three defect prevention techniques are
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
