	I cannot reproduce your results no matter how hard I try.
	I appear to have some weird logic bug that I can't find and I have spent over 4 hours trying to
	debug less than twenty lines of code.
	I'm not really sure what more I can do for something that was supposed to be a small programming
	task.
