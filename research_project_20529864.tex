\begin{abstract}
Code reviews are an effective, cheap and well-established software verification method.
Fagan was one of the first to advocate for them, and in his seminal paper in 1986 summarising their
achievements, he strongly advocated that the software engineering industry move in favour of
improving their usage.
The industry has since adopted software inspections as a go-to technique, but many other
verification and defect prevention techniques have also evolved.\\
\\
In such a climate, is the code review still useful?
Why is it still a necessary part of the software engineering defect detection and prevention
toolkit?
And how does it interact with the other, newer pieces of software engineering machinery that have
since evolved since the inception of reviews?
This paper contributes partial answers towards this line of questioning, and attempts to add more
specific and achievable subgoals that the author hopes would assist in advancing the state of
software engineering knowledge and the usefulness of code reviews in the entire defect detection and
prevention process.
