\chapter{Literature Survey} \label{chapter:litsurvey}

There are many benefits from incorporating software inspections, as well as
some drawbacks.
Some benefits, such as high defect detection rates and immediate improvements to software quality, are
obvious.
Perhaps less obvious and more subtle are the long-term benefits, such as future
defect prevention, that code reviews provide.
This chapter will, through a survey of research address these benefits and discuss the state of the
art in research.\\
\\
This chapter is arranged as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Section \ref{sec:litsurvey:reviews} discusses the merits and ideas behind reviews
	\item Section \ref{sec:litsurvey:codeRev} explores code reviews and the different kinds of code
		reviews
	\item Section \ref{sec:litsurvey:defTechs} lists a wide range of techniques for finding defects
	\item Section \ref{sec:litsurvey:strWeak} analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the different
		code reviews
	\item Section \ref{sec:litsurvey:current} discusses recent research and what the state of the art
		in research is
\end{itemize}
